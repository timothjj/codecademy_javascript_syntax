# Project 5: Rock Paper Scissors

Practice JavaScript function syntax, passing data to functions, the return keyword, ES6 arrow functions, and concise body syntax.

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic two-player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

Rock destroys scissors.
Scissors cut paper.
Paper covers rock.
If thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

# Usage
