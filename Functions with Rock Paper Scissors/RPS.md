# Codecademy Javascript Syntax Projects

# Project 5: Rock Paper Scissors

Practice JavaScript function syntax, passing data to functions, the return keyword, ES6 arrow functions, and concise body syntax.

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic two-player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

Rock destroys scissors.
Scissors cut paper.
Paper covers rock.
If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
Our code will break the game into four parts:

Get the user’s choice.
Get the computer’s choice.
Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
Start the program and display the results.
