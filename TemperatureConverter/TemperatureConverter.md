# Temperature Converter

Deep in his mountainside meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However, there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, and then to Fahrenheit, printing the Fahrenheit to the console.

# Usage

node TemperatureConverter.js <temperature in Kelvin>

node TemperatureConverter.js 300
